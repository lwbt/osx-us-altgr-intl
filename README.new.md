# US-AltGr-International Keyboard Layout for macOS

This is a custom keyboard layout for macOS.  On Linux distributions, Chrome OS
and Windows it is typically called US International with dead keys. 

A modified some ASCII art I found, which you can find
[here](./docs/ascii_art.md).


## Installation

- TODO: `install.sh`, `uninstall.sh`
- TODO: GUI
- TODO: terminal

```bash
curl
sudo cp
```

To my current knowledge you have to reboot or log out of your Mac and back in
again to be able to use it.  I think there must be a system service in macOS
which you can trigger to pickup tha changes.
