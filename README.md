# US-AltGr-International Keyboard Layout for macOS

This is a custom keyboard layout for macOS.  On Linux distributions, Chrome OS
and Windows it is typically called US International with dead keys. 

I modified some illustrative ASCII art I found, which you can find
[here](./docs/ascii_art.md).


## Installation

- TODO: describe GUI
- TODO: describe terminal

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lwbt/osx-us-altgr-intl/master/install.sh | bash
```

To my current knowledge you have to reboot or log out of your Mac and back in
again to be able to use it.  I think there must be a system service in macOS
which you can trigger to pickup tha changes.
